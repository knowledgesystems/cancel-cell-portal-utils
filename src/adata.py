    An AnnData group MUST contain entries "obs" and "var",

    The group MAY contain an entry X, which MUST be either a 
    dense or sparse array and whose shape MUST be (n_obs, n_var)

    The group MAY contain a mapping layers. 
    Entries in layers MUST be dense or sparse arrays which have 
    shapes (n_obs, n_var)

    The group MAY contain a mapping obsm. 
    Entries in obsm MUST be sparse arrays, dense arrays, or dataframes. 
    These entries MUST have a first dimension of size n_obs

    The group MAY contain a mapping varm. 
    Entries in varm MUST be sparse arrays, dense arrays, or dataframes. 
    These entries MUST have a first dimension of size n_var
